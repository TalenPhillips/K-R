# K-R

This repo is a personal exploration of the exercises in
"The C Programming Language" (second edition) along with the following tools:

    Visual Studio Code â€” with the following extensions:
        C/C++ (IntelliSense)
        C/C++ Snippets
        GitHub
    Linux Mint
    GCC (v7.2)
    Git
    GitHub

Code should use the C17 standard when possible and follow modern idioms.

Each program should be compiled with the -Wall flag, and should show zero
warnings. If warnings cannot be avoided, they will be noted in comments.

Code should not extend beyond the 80th column.

Obviously, numeric literals should be avoided, enumerations should be preferred
over define statements, and scopes should be limited as much as possible.

Code should be "const correct", and use type modifiers (short, long, unsigned)
and type qualifiers (const, volatile, static, register) whenever appropriate.

Unicode box-drawing characters should be used to format boilerplate, function
headers, and other major comments.

TODO: define naming and capitalization styles.
